A JAVA application to generate RSA keys and encrypt/decrypt messages. [Reference](https://blog.csdn.net/jijianshuai/article/details/80582187)
RSA algorithm is for private information exchange through exposed channel, in this case specifically on an anonymous forum.
Suppose that Alice wants to tell Bob a message in secret, but their communication is inevitably bugged by Eve.
Then under Eve's scrutiny, Alice and Bob can use RSA to protect their secret. The keys used in this demo is 1024-bit long, almost strong enough for any attacker.
To achieve safe communication, Alice requires a public key generated by Bob (On the other side, Bob can refuse to receive message by not sharing his public key).
After getting public key, Alice uses it to encrypt his message, the encrypted message cannot be decrypted by the public key, which prevent Eve from decryption.
Meanwhile, when generating public key, Bob get his private key which he must protect from anybody else. He can use it to decrypt the message encrypted by his public key.
As a result, Bob successfully receives a message from Alice without Eve being able to decrypt. All he need to do is share his public key and protect private one.
